# If you're reading this on GitHub...
...please notice that the blog pages are meant to be visited on my website and you might encounter slight issues, such as:

- Images not loading at all:
  - `$$ path $$` instead of the actual image path
  - for example: `![Result](/$$ path $$/result.png)`

- CSS/styling problems:
  - star ratings always appear as 5/5 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ because GitHub's Markdown previews don't support inline CSS

- no proper syntax highlighting

With that being said, enjoy it nonetheless!
